- [BREAKING] Specifying the product version has been changed to adhere to
  [ADR018](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/contributor/adr/ADR018-product_image_versioning.html)
  instead of just specifying the product version you will now have to add the
  Stackable image version as well, so `version: 1.4.1` becomes (for example)
  `version: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0` ([#207])
- Add support for Superset 1.5.1 ([#222]).

### Changed

- Required product image version changed to 2 ([#182]).
- DruidConnection namespace properties are optional now ([#187]).

### Fixed

- A DruidConnection was not established if the Druid instance was started after
  the Superset instance, this was fixed ([#187]).
- The correct secret key is used when upgrading the Superset database. This
  issue was introduced in [#173] ([#190]).
