## [23.4.0] - 2023-04-17

### Added

- Log aggregation added ([#326]).
- Deploy default and support custom affinities ([#337]).
- Extend cluster resources for status and cluster operation (paused, stopped) ([#348])
- Cluster status conditions ([#349])

### Changed

- [BREAKING]: Support specifying Service type by moving `serviceType` (which was an experimental feature) to `clusterConfig.listenerClass`.
  This enables us to later switch non-breaking to using `ListenerClasses` for the exposure of Services.
  This change is breaking, because - for security reasons - we default to the `cluster-internal` `ListenerClass`.
  If you need your cluster to be accessible from outside of Kubernetes you need to set `clusterConfig.listenerClass`
  to `external-unstable` or `external-stable` ([#350]).
- `operator-rs` `0.31.0` -> `0.35.0` -> `0.40.2`  ([#322], [#326], [#352]).
- Bumped stackable image versions to "23.4.0-rc2" ([#322], [#326]).
- Fragmented `SupersetConfig` ([#323]).
- Restructured documentation ([#344]).
- Create `ServiceAccount` for Superset clusters. Use `build_rbac_resources()` from operator-rs ([#352])

## [0.5.0] - 2022-06-30

### Added

- Configuration option `rowLimit` added ([#173]).

- Ability to add MAPBOX_API_KEY from secret added ([#178]).
- Update SupersetConfigOptions to include explicit config for MapboxApiKey ([#179])

- [BREAKING] Specifying the product version has been changed to adhere to
  [ADR018](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/contributor/adr/ADR018-product_image_versioning.html)
  instead of just specifying the product version you will now have to add the
  Stackable image version as well, so `version: 1.4.1` becomes (for example)
  `version: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0` ([#207])
- Add support for Superset 1.5.1 ([#222]).

### Changed

- Required product image version changed to 2 ([#182]).
- DruidConnection namespace properties are optional now ([#187]).

### Fixed

- A DruidConnection was not established if the Druid instance was started after
  the Superset instance, this was fixed ([#187]).
- The correct secret key is used when upgrading the Superset database. This
  issue was introduced in [#173] ([#190]).
