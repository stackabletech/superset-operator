= First steps

== Database for the Superset metadata

The metadata of Superset (slices, connections, tables, dashboards, ...) is stored in an SQL
database.

For testing purposes, you can spin up a PostgreSQL database with the following commands:

[source,bash]
include::example$code/getting_started.sh[tag=add-bitnami-repo]

[source,bash]
include::example$code/getting_started.sh[tag=install-bitnami-psql]

== Secret with Superset credentials

A secret with the necessary credentials must be created, this entails database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Superset itself:

[source,yaml]
include::example$code/superset-credentials.yaml[]



The `connections.secretKey` will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used
for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes.

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing
the Superset metadata.

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.
Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP.

== Creation of a Superset node

A Superset node must be created as a custom resource:

[source,yaml]
include::example$code/superset.yaml[]


`metadata.name` contains the name of the Superset cluster.

The label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in `spec.version`.

Please note that the version you need to specify is not only the version of Apache Superset which
you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable
version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For
a list of available versions please check our
https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:docker:v2%2Fstackable%2Fsuperset%2Ftags[image registry].
It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available.

`spec.statsdExporterVersion` must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository.

The previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.credentialsSecret`.

The `spec.loadExamplesOnInit` key is optional and defaults to `false`, it can be set to `true` to load example data into Superset when the database is initialized.

The `rowLimit` configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data.


=== Initialization of the Superset database

The first time the cluster is created, the operator creates a `SupersetDB` resource with the same name as the cluster.  It ensures that the database is initialized (schema created, admin user created).

A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while.

== Using Superset

When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the
browser.

The Superset port which defaults to `8088` can be forwarded to the local host:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl port-forward service/simple-superset-external 8088
----

Then it can be opened in the browser with `http://localhost:8088`.

Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret:

If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available:
