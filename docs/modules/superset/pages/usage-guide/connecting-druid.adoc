The operator can automatically connect Superset clusters that it manages to Apache Druid clusters managed by the xref:druid:index.adoc[Stackable operator for Apache Druid].

To do so, create a _DruidConnection_ resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: DruidConnection
metadata:
  name: superset-druid-connection
spec:
  superset:  # <1>
    name: superset
    namespace: default
  druid:  # <2>
    name: druid
    namespace: default

----

<1> The `name` and `namespace` in `spec.superset` refer to the Superset cluster that you want to connect. Following our example above, the name is `superset`.
<2> In `spec.druid` you specify the `name` and `namespace` of your Druid cluster. Following our example above, the name is `druid`.

The `namespace` part is optional in both cases; if it is omitted it will default to the namespace of the DruidConnection.

Once Superset startup is complete and the database is initialized, the Superset operator will create a {k8s-job}[Job] that will connect to the Superset cluster to run an import command to add the Druid cluster as a datasource.

IMPORTANT: The Job is connecting to the Superset Pods. If you are restricting network traffic in your Kubernetes cluster, make sure to configure a {k8s-network-policies}[NetworkPolicy] that allows the Job to connect to Superset.

Once the Job is completed you can see the Druid cluster as a database in the user interface under Data > Databases:
