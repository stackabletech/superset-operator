= Connecting Apache Druid clusters

The operator can automatically connect Superset to Apache Druid clusters managed by the https://docs.stackable.tech/druid/index.html[Stackable Druid Cluster].

To do so, create a _DruidConnection_ resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: DruidConnection
metadata:
  name: superset-druid-connection
spec:
  superset:
    name: superset
    namespace: default
  druid:
    name: my-druid-cluster
    namespace: default

----

The `name` and `namespace` in `spec.superset` refer to the Superset cluster that you want to connect. Following our example above, the name is `superset`.

In `spec.druid` you specify the `name` and `namespace` of your Druid cluster.

The `namespace` part is optional; if it is omitted it will default to the namespace of the DruidConnection.

The namespace for both the Superset and Druid clusters can be omitted, in which case the Operator will assume that they are in the same namespace as the DruidConnection.

Once the database is initialized, the connection will be added to the cluster by the operator. You can see it in the user interface under Data > Databases:
