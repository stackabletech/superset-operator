https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[resource requirements]:

Corresponding to the values above, the operator uses the following resource defaults:

nodes:
  roleGroups:

      config:
        resources:
          cpu:
            min: '300m'
            max: "1200m"
          memory:
            limit: '1000Mi'
