= Storage and resource configuration

== Resource Requests

include::concepts:stackable_resource_requests.adoc[]

If no resource requests are configured explicitly, the Superset operator uses the following defaults:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          cpu:
            min: '200m'
            max: "4"
          memory:
            limit: '2Gi'
----

WARNING: The default values are _most likely_ not sufficient to run a production cluster. Please adapt according to your requirements.
