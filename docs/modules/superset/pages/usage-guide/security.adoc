== [[authentication]]Authentication
Every user has to be authenticated before using Superset: there are several ways in which this can be set up.

=== Webinterface
The default setting is to manually set up users via the Webinterface.

=== LDAP

Superset supports xref:nightly@home:concepts:authentication.adoc[authentication] of users against an LDAP server. This requires setting up an xref:nightly@home:concepts:authentication.adoc#authenticationclass[AuthenticationClass] for the LDAP server.
The AuthenticationClass is then referenced in the SupersetCluster resource as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SupersetCluster
metadata:
  name: superset-with-ldap-server
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 1.5.1
    stackableVersion: 23.4.0-rc2
  [...]
  authenticationConfig:
    authenticationClass: ldap    # <1>
    userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <2>
----

<1> The reference to an AuthenticationClass called `ldap`
<2> The default role to which all users are assigned

Users that log in with LDAP are assigned to a default https://superset.apache.org/docs/security/#roles[Role] which is specified with the `userRegistrationRole` property.

You can follow the xref:nightly@home:tutorials:authentication_with_openldap.adoc[] tutorial to learn how to set up an AuthenticationClass for an LDAP server, as well as consulting the xref:nightly@home:reference:authenticationclass.adoc[] reference.

== [[authorization]]Authorization
Superset has a concept called `Roles` which allows you to grant user permissions based on roles.
Have a look at the https://superset.apache.org/docs/security[Superset documentation on Security].

=== Webinterface
You can view all the available roles in the Webinterface of Superset and can also assign users to these roles.

=== LDAP
Superset supports assigning https://superset.apache.org/docs/security/#roles[Roles] to users based on their LDAP group membership, though this is not yet supported by the Stackable operator.
All the users logging in via LDAP get assigned to the same role which you can configure via the attribute `authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole` on the `SupersetCluster` object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SupersetCluster
metadata:
  name: superset-with-ldap-server
spec:
  [...]
  authenticationConfig:
    authenticationClass: ldap
    userRegistrationRole: Admin  # <1>
----

<1> All users are assigned to the `Admin` role
