= First steps

Once you have followed the steps in  xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] for the Operator and its dependencies, you will now go through the steps to set up and connect to a Superset instance.

== Database for the Superset metadata

Superset metadata (slices, connections, tables, dashboards etc.) is stored in an SQL database.

For testing purposes, you can spin up a PostgreSQL database with the following commands:

[source,bash]
include::example$code/getting_started.sh[tag=add-bitnami-repo]

[source,bash]
include::example$code/getting_started.sh[tag=install-bitnami-psql]

== Secret with Superset credentials

A secret with the necessary credentials must be created: this contains database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Superset itself. Create a file called `superset-credentials.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/superset-credentials.yaml[]

And apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-superset-credentials]

The `connections.secretKey` will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used
for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes.

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing
the Superset metadata.

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.
Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP.

== Creation of a Superset node

A Superset node must be created as a custom resource, create file called `superset.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/superset.yaml[]

And apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-superset-cluster]


`metadata.name` contains the name of the Superset cluster.

The label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in `spec.version`.

Please note that the version you need to specify is not only the version of Apache Superset which
you want to roll out, but has to also include the Stackable version as shown. This Stackable
version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For
a list of available versions please check our
https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:docker:v2%2Fstackable%2Fsuperset%2Ftags[image registry].
It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available.

`spec.statsdExporterVersion` must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository.

The previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.credentialsSecret`.

The `spec.loadExamplesOnInit` key is optional and defaults to `false`, it can be set to `true` to load example data into Superset when the database is initialized.

The `rowLimit` configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data.

The `webserverTimeout` configuration option defines the maximum number of seconds a Superset request can take before timing out.
This settings effect the maximum duration a query to an underlying datasource can take.
If you get timeout errors before your query returns the result you may need to increase this timeout.

=== Initialization of the Superset database

The first time the cluster is created, the operator creates a `SupersetDB` resource with the same name as the cluster.  It ensures that the database is initialized (with the creation of a schema and admin user).

A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while.

You can use kubectl to wait on the resource:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=wait-supersetdb]

== Using Superset

When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the
browser.

The Superset port which defaults to `8088` can be forwarded to the local host:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=port-forwarding]

Then it can be opened in the browser with `http://localhost:8088`.

Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret:

If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available:

Great! You have set up a Superset instance and connected to it!
