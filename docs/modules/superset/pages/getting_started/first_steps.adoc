= First steps

Once you have followed the steps in  xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] for the Operator and its dependencies, you will now go through the steps to set up and connect to a Superset instance.

== Database for the Superset metadata

Superset metadata (slices, connections, tables, dashboards etc.) is stored in an SQL database.

For testing, you can set up a PostgreSQL database with these commands:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=add-bitnami-repo]

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-bitnami-psql]

WARNING: This setup is not suitable for production use.
Refer to the xref:required-external-components[supported databases] for production-ready database setup instructions.

== Secret with Superset credentials

You need to create a secret with the required credentials (database connection credentials and an admin account for Superset).
Create a file called `superset-credentials.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/superset-credentials.yaml[]

Apply the Secret:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-superset-credentials]

The `connections.secretKey` will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used for any other security-related needs by extensions.
It should be a long, random string.

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing the Superset metadata.

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.
If using non-default authentication (e.g., LDAP), the admin user is disabled.

== Creation of a Superset node

A Superset node must be created as a custom resource, create a file called `superset.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/superset.yaml[]

And apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-superset-cluster]


`metadata.name` contains the name of the Superset cluster.

The previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.clusterConfig.credentialsSecret`.

The `rowLimit` configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data.

The `webserverTimeout` configuration option defines the maximum number of seconds a Superset request can take before timing out.
These settings affect the maximum duration a query to an underlying datasource can take.
If you get timeout errors before your query returns the result you may need to increase this timeout.

You need to wait for the Superset node to finish deploying. You can do so with this command:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=wait-superset]

== Connecting to the web interface

Once the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, you can open Superset in your browser.

To forward the Superset port (`8088`) to localhost, run:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=port-forwarding]

Then, open `http://localhost:8088` in your browser and log in with the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret.

Superset is now ready for use.
If you want to load sample data and dashboards and explore its Superset's functionality, proceed to the next step.

== Loading examples and accessing example dashboards

To have some data to play with and some dashboards to explore, Superset comes with some example data that you can load.
To do so, create a file `superset-load-examples-job.yaml` with this content:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/superset-load-examples-job.yaml[]

This Kubernetes Job uses the same connection information and credentials as the Superset instance to load the example data.
Run the Job and wait for it to finish with the following command:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=load-examples]

The Job will take a few minutes to terminate.
Afterwards, check back again on the web interface.
New dashboards should be available:

Great!
Now you can explore this sample data, run queries on it or create your own dashboards.
