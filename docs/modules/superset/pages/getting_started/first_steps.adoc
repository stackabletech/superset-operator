= First steps

Once you have followed the steps in  xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] for the Operator and its dependencies, you will now go through the steps to set up and connect to a Superset instance.

== Database for the Superset metadata

Superset metadata (slices, connections, tables, dashboards etc.) is stored in an SQL database.

For testing purposes, you can spin up a PostgreSQL database with the following commands:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=add-bitnami-repo]

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=install-bitnami-psql]

WARNING: This setup is unsuitable for production use! Follow the specific production setup instuctions for one of the xref:required-external-components[supported databases] to get a production-ready database.

== Secret with Superset credentials

A secret with the necessary credentials must be created: this contains database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Superset itself. Create a file called `superset-credentials.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/superset-credentials.yaml[]

And apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-superset-credentials]

The `connections.secretKey` will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used
for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes.

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing
the Superset metadata.

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.
Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP.

== Creation of a Superset node

A Superset node must be created as a custom resource, create a file called `superset.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$getting_started/superset.yaml[]

And apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=apply-superset-cluster]


`metadata.name` contains the name of the Superset cluster.

The previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.credentialsSecret`.

The `rowLimit` configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data.

The `webserverTimeout` configuration option defines the maximum number of seconds a Superset request can take before timing out.
These settings affect the maximum duration a query to an underlying datasource can take.
If you get timeout errors before your query returns the result you may need to increase this timeout.

== Connecting to the web interface

When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the
browser.

The Superset port which defaults to `8088` can be forwarded to the local host:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=port-forwarding]

Then it can be opened in the browser with `http://localhost:8088`.

Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret:

== Loading examples and accessing example dashboards

To have some data to play with and some dashboards to explore, Superset comes with some example data that you can load:

[source,bash]
include::example$getting_started/getting_started.sh[tag=load-examples]

This command will take a few minutes to load the data. Afterwards, check back again on the web interface. New dashboards should be available:

Great! You have set up a Superset instance and connected to it!

== What's next

Look at the xref:usage-guide/index.adoc[] to find out more about configuring your Superset instance or have a look at the Superset documentation to https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/creating-your-first-dashboard[create your first dashboard].
