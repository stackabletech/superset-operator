= Getting started

This guide helps you get started with Superset using the Stackable Operator.
It covers the installation of the Operator and its dependencies, setting up your first Superset instance, connecting to it, and exploring sample data.

== Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need the following:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== What's next

The guide is divided into two steps:

* xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[Installing the Operators].
