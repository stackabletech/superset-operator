= Usage

== Database for the Superset metadata

The metadata of Superset (slices, connections, tables, dashboards, ...) is stored in an SQL
database.

For testing purposes, you can spin up a PostgreSQL database with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

helm install superset bitnami/postgresql \
    --set postgresqlUsername=superset \
    --set postgresqlPassword=superset \
    --set postgresqlDatabase=superset
----

== Secret with Superset credentials

A secret with the necessary credentials must be created, this entails database connection credentials as well as an admin account for superset itself:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: simple-superset-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  adminUser.username: admin
  adminUser.firstname: Superset
  adminUser.lastname: Admin
  adminUser.email: admin@superset.com
  adminUser.password: admin
  connections.secretKey: thisISaSECRET_1234
  connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri: postgresql://superset:superset@superset-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/superset
----

The `connections.secretKey` will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used
for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes.

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing
the Superset metadata.

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.

== Creation of a Superset node

A Superset node must be created as a custom resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SupersetCluster
metadata:
  name: superset
spec:
  version: 1.4.1
  statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4
  credentialsSecret: simple-superset-credentials
  loadExamplesOnInit: true
  nodes:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        config:

----

`metadata.name` contains the name of the Superset cluster.

The label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in `spec.version`.

`spec.statsdExporterVersion` must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository.

The previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.credentialsSecret`.

The `spec.loadExamplesOnInit` key is optional and defaults to `false`, it can be set to `true` to load example data into superset when the database is initialized.

=== Initialization of the Superset database

The first time the cluster is created, the operator creates a `SupersetDB` resource with the same name as the cluster.  It ensures that the database is initialized (schema created, admin user created).

A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while.

== Using Superset

When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the
browser.

The Superset port which defaults to `8088` can be forwarded to the local host:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl port-forward superset-node-default-0 8088
----

Then it can be opened in the browser with `http://localhost:8088`.

Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret:

If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available:

== Connecting Apache Druid Clusters

The operator can automatically connect superset clusters to Apache Druid clusters managed by the https://docs.stackable.tech/druid/index.html[Stackable Druid Cluster].

To do so, create a `DruidConnection` resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: DruidConnection
metadata:
  name: superset-druid-connection
spec:
  superset:
    name: superset
    namespace: default
  druid:
    name: my-druid-cluster
    namespace: default

----

The `name` and `namespace` in `spec.superset` refer to the superset cluster that you want to connect. Following our example above, the name is `superset`.

In `spec.druid` you specify the `name` and `namespace` of your Druid cluster.

Once the database is initialized, the connection will be added to the cluster by the operator. You can see it in the user interface under Data > Databases:

== Monitoring

The managed Superset instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See
xref:home::monitoring.adoc[] for more details.
