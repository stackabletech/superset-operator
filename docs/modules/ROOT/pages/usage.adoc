= Usage

== Database for the Superset metadata

The metadata of Superset (slices, connections, tables, dashboards, ...) is stored in an SQL
database.

For testing purposes, you can spin up a PostgreSQL database with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

helm install superset bitnami/postgresql \
    --set auth.username=superset \
    --set auth.password=superset \
    --set auth.database=superset
----

== Secret with Superset credentials

A secret with the necessary credentials must be created, this entails database connection credentials as well as an admin account for Superset itself:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: simple-superset-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  adminUser.username: admin
  adminUser.firstname: Superset
  adminUser.lastname: Admin
  adminUser.email: admin@superset.com
  adminUser.password: admin
  connections.secretKey: thisISaSECRET_1234
  connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri: postgresql://superset:superset@superset-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local/superset
----

The `connections.secretKey` will be used for securely signing the session cookies and can be used
for any other security related needs by extensions. It should be a long random string of bytes.

`connections.sqlalchemyDatabaseUri` must contain the connection string to the SQL database storing
the Superset metadata.

The `adminUser` fields are used to create an admin user.
Please note that the admin user will be disabled if you use a non-default authentication mechanism like LDAP.

== Creation of a Superset node

A Superset node must be created as a custom resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SupersetCluster
metadata:
  name: superset
spec:
  version: 1.5.1-stackable0.1.0
  statsdExporterVersion: v0.22.4
  credentialsSecret: simple-superset-credentials
  loadExamplesOnInit: true
  nodes:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        config:
          rowLimit: 10000
----

`metadata.name` contains the name of the Superset cluster.

The label of the Docker image provided by Stackable must be set in `spec.version`.

Please note that the version you need to specify is not only the version of Apache Superset which
you want to roll out, but has to be amended with a Stackable version as shown. This Stackable
version is the version of the underlying container image which is used to execute the processes. For
a list of available versions please check our
https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:docker:v2%2Fstackable%2Fsuperset%2Ftags[image registry].
It should generally be safe to simply use the latest image version that is available.

`spec.statsdExporterVersion` must contain the tag of a statsd-exporter Docker image in the Stackable repository.

The previously created secret must be referenced in `spec.credentialsSecret`.

The `spec.loadExamplesOnInit` key is optional and defaults to `false`, it can be set to `true` to load example data into Superset when the database is initialized.

The `rowLimit` configuration option defines the row limit when requesting chart data.

=== Initialization of the Superset database

The first time the cluster is created, the operator creates a `SupersetDB` resource with the same name as the cluster.  It ensures that the database is initialized (schema created, admin user created).

A Kubernetes job is created which starts a pod to initialize the database. This can take a while.

== Using Superset

When the Superset node is created and the database is initialized, Superset can be opened in the
browser.

The Superset port which defaults to `8088` can be forwarded to the local host:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl port-forward service/simple-superset-external 8088
----

Then it can be opened in the browser with `http://localhost:8088`.

Enter the admin credentials from the Kubernetes secret:

If the examples were loaded then some dashboards are already available:

== Authentication
Every user has to authenticate themselves before using Superset.
There are multiple options to set up the authentication of users.

=== Webinterface
The default setting is to manually set up users via the Webinterface.

=== LDAP
Superset supports authentication of users against an LDAP server.
Have a look at https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/blob/main/examples/superset-with-ldap.yaml[the LDAP example] and the general xref:commons-operator::authenticationclass.adoc[Stackable Authentication] documentation on how to set it up.
In general, it requires you to specify a xref:commons-operator::authenticationclass.adoc[`AuthenticationClass`] which is used to authenticate the users. In this example we assign all the users the `Admin` role once they log into Superset.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SupersetCluster
metadata:
  name: superset-with-ldap-server-veri-tls
spec:
  version: 1.5.1-stackable0.1.0
  [...]
  authenticationConfig:
    authenticationClass: superset-with-ldap-server-veri-tls-ldap
    userRegistrationRole: Admin
----

== Authorization
Superset has a concept called `Roles` which allows you to grant user permissions based on roles.
Have a look at the https://superset.apache.org/docs/security[Superset documentation on Security].

=== Webinterface
You can see all the available roles in the Webinterface of Superset.
You can view all the available roles in the Webinterface of Superset and can also assign users to these roles.

=== LDAP
Superset supports assigning roles to users based on their LDAP group membership.
This is not supported yet.
Currently all the users logging in via LDAP get assigned the same role which you can configure via the attribute `authenticationConfig.userRegistrationRole` on the `SupersetCluster` object.

== Connecting Apache Druid Clusters

The operator can automatically connect Superset to Apache Druid clusters managed by the https://docs.stackable.tech/druid/index.html[Stackable Druid Cluster].

To do so, create a `DruidConnection` resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: superset.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: DruidConnection
metadata:
  name: superset-druid-connection
spec:
  superset:
    name: superset
    namespace: default
  druid:
    name: my-druid-cluster
    namespace: default

----

The `name` and `namespace` in `spec.superset` refer to the Superset cluster that you want to connect. Following our example above, the name is `superset`.

In `spec.druid` you specify the `name` and `namespace` of your Druid cluster.

The `namespace` part is optional; if it is omitted it will default to the namespace of the DruidConnection.

The namespace for the Superset and Druid cluster can be omitted, in that case the Operator will assume that they are in the same namespace as the DruidConnection.

Once the database is initialized, the connection will be added to the cluster by the operator. You can see it in the user interface under Data > Databases:

image::superset-databases.png[Superset databases showing the connected Druid cluster]

== Monitoring

The managed Superset instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics. See
xref:home:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

== Configuration & Environment Overrides

The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables,
either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over
the less specific one (role).

IMPORTANT: Overriding certain properties which are set by the operator (such as the `STATS_LOGGER`)
can interfere with the operator and can lead to problems.

=== Configuration Properties

For a role or role group, at the same level of `config`, you can specify `configOverrides` for the
`superset_config.py`. For example, if you want to set the CSV export encoding and the preferred
databases adapt the `nodes` section of the cluster resource like so:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      configOverrides:
        superset_config.py:
          CSV_EXPORT: "{'encoding': 'utf-8'}"
          PREFERRED_DATABASES: |-
            [
                'PostgreSQL',
                'Presto',
                'MySQL',
                'SQLite',
                # etc.
            ]
----

Just as for the `config`, it is possible to specify this at the role level as well:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  configOverrides:
    superset_config.py:
      CSV_EXPORT: "{'encoding': 'utf-8'}"
      PREFERRED_DATABASES: |-
        [
            'PostgreSQL',
            'Presto',
            'MySQL',
            'SQLite',
            # etc.
        ]
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
----

All override property values must be strings. They are treated as Python expressions. So care must
be taken to not produce an invalid configuration.

For a full list of configuration options we refer to the
https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/config.py[main config file for Superset].

=== Environment Variables

In a similar fashion, environment variables can be (over)written. For example per role group:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      envOverrides:
        FLASK_ENV: development
----

or per role:

[source,yaml]
----
nodes:
  envOverrides:
    FLASK_ENV: development
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
----

// cliOverrides don't make sense for this operator, so the feature is omitted for now
